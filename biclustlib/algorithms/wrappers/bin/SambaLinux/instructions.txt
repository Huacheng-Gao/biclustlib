How to run SAMBA via shell:
=============================
The expander.opt file (attached) is usually written by Expander and depends
on the selection of parameters by the user.

You can find some info about these configurable parameters under
http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/expander/help/ver5.1Help/Biclustering_GE_Data.htm


The file sambaInputFile.exp.ipt contains a sample of the
expression data that is to be analyzed in the required format.
The file sambaKeyFile.txt contains the path of this file and some info
about it. You should put your own files and make the file sambaKeyFile point
at them

Then, to run samba, type the command:

samba.exe <locationOfConstantOptFiles>/valspace.opt
<locationOfConstantOptFiles>/graph.opt ibic.opt expander.opt

This is assuming that the curent dir is the one in which samba.exe is
placed as well as ibic.opt and expander.opt (otherwise you need full path).

  The <locationOfConstantOptFiles> depends on the selection of the options.
  You can select one out of 6 options (all dirs are under
sambaConstOptFiles).  You will find a table which describes the advantages
and disadvantages of each option under
http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/expander/help/ver5.1Help/Biclustering_GE_Data.htm
